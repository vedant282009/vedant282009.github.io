        <p>The US. Open is my favorite tennis players because it always has good talent and I live close by. I always go 3 or 4 times. Played on hard courts, itâ€™s known for its vibrant atmosphere and iconic night matches at Arthur Ashe Stadium. As one of the sport's premier events, it attracts the world's top players and has produced many historic moments in tennis.</p>
